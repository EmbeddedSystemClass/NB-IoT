First notice that the cell network should support narrowband IoT, 
not all networks support NB IoT. The SIM card should be NB IoT enabled, 
again regular SIM cards would not work. Consult with your cell network 
provider if they have NB IoT support and if you can get NB IoT enabled 
SIM card (if you haven't already).

Once you are in the proper network with the proper SIM card placed it 
in the module - connect the USB cable to the board. At this point you 
need to turn on the board by pressing and holding down the two buttons 
(the board has two buttons - one is PWR_KEY1 for power on, 
the other RST_KEY1 for reset). Open the serial terminal. In order to 
connect to the network you would need to enter a set of commands. 
The set of commands we use here during testing is exactly this:

AT - baudrate sync between the board an the terminal
AT+CPIN? - checks if the SIM card requires pin code
AT+CFUN=1 - enables full functionality
AT+CEREG=5 - network registration status

The settings below depend on your network operator. These commands
are required only during the initial setting.

Ask the cell operator for the settings:

AT+QBAND=1,3 - select network band - try 0 if in doubt
AT+QCGDEFCONT="IP","iot.test" - AP name; different for each network
AT+CEDRXS=0,5 - depends on your network
AT+QRST=1 - resets the module so that the new settings can get applied.

Notice that the first time when you connect to the network it might take 
significant amount of time (sometimes up to 10 minutes). This depends 
on the signal strength. Subsequent connections should be much faster, 
almost instant.

You should check the AT commands manual for more info about each command.

The board has two LEDs - one is related to the battery charger circuit 
(if you have Li-Po battery attached). It is named CHRG1. The other one 
is for the cell network status, it is called LED_Netlight1.
